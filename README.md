# CentileBrain
CentileBrain (https://centilebrain.org) offers the opportunity to generate indices of brain regional deviations (https://centilebrain.org/#/model) for research purpose based on models provided by the ENIGMA Lifespan Working Group.

In addition, we are pleased to present on this web portal our (1) developmental brain-age model (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAGE), which is founded on morphometric data from healthy individuals aged 5 to 22 years; (2) pre-trained sex-specific brain-age models (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge2) that encompasses a significant portion of the human lifespan (3-90 years); and (3) pre-trained sex-specific network-level brain age models (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge_network) of 3-95 years.
