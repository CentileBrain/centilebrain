# CentileBrain
CentileBrain (https://centilebrain.org) offers the opportunity to generate indices of brain regional deviations (https://centilebrain.org/#/model) for research purpose based on models provided by the ENIGMA Lifespan Working Group.

In addition, we are pleased to provide, through this web portal, (1) developmental and global brain-age models (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAGE) trained on morphometric data from healthy individuals aged 5–22 years; (2) pre-trained, sex-specific global brain-age models (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge2) spanning much of the human lifespan (3–90 years); and (3) pre-trained, sex-specific network-level brain-age models (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge_network) covering ages 3–95 years.
