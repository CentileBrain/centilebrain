CentileBrain (https://centilebrain.org) offers the opportunity to generate indices of brain regional deviations (https://centilebrain.org/#/model) for research purpose based on models provided by the ENIGMA Lifespan Working Group.

In addition, we are pleased to present on this web portal our developmental brain-age model (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAGE), which is founded on morphometric data from healthy individuals aged 5 to 22 years, as well as our pre-trained sex-specific brain-age model (https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge2) that encompasses a significant portion of the human lifespan (5-90 years).
